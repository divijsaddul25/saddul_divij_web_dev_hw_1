              <h2>Two Coffee Bottles</h2>
              <p>These are two glass bottles which visibly contain frappucino.
                Glass is superior to plastic and steel because of its ability to stay neutral 
                to the liquid insides, implying that there are no harsh chemicals leaked in to the 
                beverage which is the case with plastic and no metallic aftertaste, which is the case with steel.

                <h2>Rugged Water Bottle</h2>
                <p>This is an orange stainless steel bottle.
                  It is a double walled bottle, which implies that it
                  keeps liquids both hot or cold for extended periods of time.
                  It has a rubberised texture, which gives it a matte look and gives it more grip.</p>

                <h2>Two Bottles Of Champagne</h2>
                <p>These are two champagne flutes.Their peculiar shape allows them to be compact
                  and voluminous simultaneously, 
                  which implies that more champagne can be drank from a single flute than a normal cup.
                  Additionally, their design gives them a refined and sophisticated look.

                <p>Tthis is a football pitch, the camera is on the ground and focus on the grass, leaving
                  the background blurred, due to which it lets out this blue hue which complements the shade of the grass.</p>
